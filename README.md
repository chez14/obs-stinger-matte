## Getting Started

To use the sample file, you can go to [`rendered`](./rendered/) folder and
download the resolution you need. Add those file to the OBS as stinger and
configure it as directed on that folder.

To use the After Effect template file, simply download the repo, open with After
Effect and start working on it. I've added several info on the INFO composition.
Please take a look.

To use the Render Presets, you can import it from the [`presets`](presets/)
folder to your Premiere Pro or Media Encoder. I suggest you use Media Encoder
because that's how i import and export stuff =3=
