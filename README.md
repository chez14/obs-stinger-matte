## Stinger with Track Matte Template/Sample for OBS

Done in AE CC2019. More instructions later.

## What's Included:
- Sample transition with Alpha Channel, and track-matte on the Right.
- Template for making the transition, full with extra information on it.
- Rendering preset for Media Encoder (and apparently Premiere Pro).

## License

The video file under the `rendered` folder are free to use for commercial and
personal project. No attribution required, no redistribution allowed. **Please
send the link to this repo when you're redistributing it.**

The template has it's own license. Please check the template for more
information on it.

The encoding/render preset have same license with the video file. Please include
the link when you're directing your user/viewers/customer when you're trying to
give the presets.

I'm still finding the correct license type for this repo. I usually use the MIT
project for this one but apparently I have to be extra carefull with this
license applied to creative stuff since the blur line is quite... well
"playable".

Basically here's what i want:
- Crediting me is not required, tough if you do, I will really appreciate it.

- Redistributing it "as is" or as part of your software and/or project with no
  modifications are not allowed. You have to give link to this repository if you
  want your user to download the stuff.

- I give no lialibility towards any of this files, pieces or renders since
  everything is given to you for free.

- You're free to use it for personal and commercial projects.
