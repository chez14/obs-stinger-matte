## Rendered Videos

This folder contains rendered videos that can be use directly for your OBS.

You can start testing your OBS to use the following videos according to your
need. Here's the setting that are works quite stable in my streaming
environment:

| Audio Fade Style                     | Fade out to transition point then fade in                                   |
